    <h2>Python Tutorial</h2>
      <p> Python tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Python. Our Python tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.
          Python is a simple, general purpose, high level, and object-oriented programming language.</p>

<p>Python is an interpreted scripting language also. Guido Van Rossum is known as the founder of Python programming.</p>

      <p>Our Python tutorial includes all topics of Python Programming such as installation, control statements, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionary, Modules, Exceptions, Date and Time, File I/O, Programs, etc. There are also given Python interview questions to help you better understand Python Programming.</p>

      <h2> What is Python</h2>
      <p>Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.</p>
      <p>Python is easy to learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for Application Development.

Python's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.

<p>Python supports multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.

Python is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming. That is why it is known as multipurpose programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD, etc.

<p>We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically typed so we can write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.

          <p>Python makes the development and debugging fast because there is no compilation step included in Python development, and edit-test-debug cycle is very fast.</p>

    <h4>History of Python</h4>
    <p>Python laid its foundation in the late 1980s.
    <p>The implementation of Python was started in the December 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at CWI in Netherland.
    <p>In February 1991, van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.
    <p>In 1994, Python 1.0 was released with new features like: lambda, map, filter, and reduce.
    <p>Python 2.0 added new features like: list comprehensions, garbage collection system.
    <p>On December 3, 2008, Python 3.0 (also called "Py3K") was released. It was designed to rectify fundamental flaw of the language.
    <p>ABC programming language is said to be the predecessor of Python language which was capable of Exception Handling and interfacing with Amoeba Operating System.
